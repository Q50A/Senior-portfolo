      <h4>Character Quiz</h4>
      <a href="https://popcode.org/?snapshot=33d5212c-ab98-4b65-a38a-a0000feed766" target="_blank"><img src="quiz.png" alt="characterquiz" id="quiz"></a>
      <figcaption>The goal of this project was to create a quiz where the answer would reveal a television character. <br>You will be assigned the character that most closely corresponds to the questions you answered. <br>Our knowledge of utilizing if/else conditions in JavaScript was put to the test with this assignment. <br>I think the process of creating the project taught me a lot.</figcaption>

      <h4>Adventure Game</h4>
      <a href="https://popcode.org/?snapshot=2534ddb1-f8a5-477b-ab24-9a08079ded06" target="_blank"><img src="adventure.png" alt="adventuregame" id="adventure"></a>
      <figcaption>We had to use jQuery actions to create an adventure game for this assignment. <br>It was my first experience with these new activities, therefore mastering them was crucial to completing this project. <br>We were meant to be taken back to the game's starting point by clicking the button. <br> As a result, clicking the button returns you to the home page.</figcaption>

      <h4>Social Media Page</h4>
      <a href="https://unit-4-project-social-media-page-nathanielbabay2.seniorspds-56-fall-2023.repl.co/" target="_blank"><img src="sam.png" alt="sam" id="sam"></a>
      <figcaption>For this project we had to make a social media page for someone we classified as a hero. <br>I chose my favorite artist Denzel Curry. <br>I felt like when making this project it helped me better understand the flexbox tool.<br> I understood what each position meant but applying it to a website where there's multiple positions it really helped. <br>I struggled on positioning my divs correctly so they all were coherent with each other.</figcaption>

      <h4>Chatbot</h4>
      <a href="https://popcode.org/?snapshot=0c62cd22-6a0e-45e1-9ff1-961576022ec1" target="_blank"><img src="chatbot.png" alt="chatbot" id="bot"></a>
      <figcaption>We had to make a chatbot where you would send a message and it would appear in the feed tothe other person.<br> The most important thing I learned while making the chatbot was using the mastering the append feature.</figcaption>

      <h4>Basketball Counter</h4>
      <a href="https://popcode.org/?snapshot=e57233d9-3adb-44e8-a29f-c7ad1b7082fa" target="_blank"><img src="basket.png" alt="basketgame" id="basket"></a>
      <figcaption>For the Basketball Counter we had to use our skills of jquery to keep a counter for how many points were scored in the game. <br>I learned how to make a counter with jquery.</figcaption>

      <h4>Gallery Project</h4>
      <a href="https://popcode.org/?snapshot=98f0e692-4877-41e7-a63a-2de09868a815" target="_blank"><img src="gallery.png" alt="gallery" id="gallery"></a>
      <figcaption>For the college packing list we had to use buttons to append items on to a list.<br> I learned how to use the click function better. <br>This was something I previously worked on but still struggled. So having this extra practice was really good for me.</figcaption>
